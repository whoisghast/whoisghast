üëã Hey there, I'm Ghast

### What I'm working on
- [**ionware**](https://discord.gg/ionware), a lightweight Java fabric mod 1.19.2 that elevates your gameplay.
- [automata], a statically-typed, domain-specific, procedural, and predictable programming language that defines finite-state machines ([FSMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)).

### What I am
- The COO at [Exalon Technologies].
- I'd prefer to live in an igloo but climate change is making it impossible.

### What I like in tech
- Parser, compilers, tracers. The stuff that programming languages need to work.
- Metaprogramming libraries and utilities, like code generation and preprocessing.
- Finding creative ways to optimize large programs in both speed, memory and complexity.
- The occasional bit of reverse engineering. Mainly Windows apps.

### What I like _outside_ of tech
- The cold. Warming yourself up is better than cooling yourself down.
- Forests. Trees. Flora and fauna. Staying inside all day makes me go crazy.
- Writing. Very domain-specific, shouldn't be of interest to most people.
- Simplicity. I practice simple living and self-sufficiency. Recommended reads:
  - [Voluntary Simplicity](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/305597) by Duane Elgin.
  - The _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius. You can easily find a copy online.
- Chicken soup. üêî
